# Local RAG Application

This is a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built using Streamlit. It allows users to upload a PDF, ask questions about its content, and get answers. If the answer is not found in the document, it retrieves the most relevant content and provides the response locally.

## Features

- Upload PDFs and process their text.
- Use FAISS for efficient document retrieval.
- Use a local question-answering model for response generation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-app.git
   cd rag-app
